# WebDev1Project
My project from first first year web development class built using bootstrap, and A-frame. Bootstrap was used to make the website responsive.
The web virtual reality portion was used using the A-frame framework. I used a picture taken with my smartphone rather than using one from a virtual reality camera. I wanted to see how close a picture taken with a regular smartphone compares to one from a vr camera for this purpose. The virtual reality portion is very rough.
